# Database-Normalization-Analytics
# Database Schema Design and Normalization for Analytics-Oriented Applications

## Project Description
This project demonstrates database normalization from UNF to 3NF using a Retail Analytics example.

## Tools Used
- XAMPP (MySQL)
- phpMyAdmin
- GitHub

## Database Tables
- Customer
- Orders
- Order_Details
- Product
- Category

## Normalization Steps

### 1NF
Removed repeating groups and ensured atomic values.

### 2NF
Eliminated partial dependency by separating customer details.

### 3NF
Removed transitive dependency by creating Category table.

## Conclusion
The database was successfully normalized up to 3NF, reducing redundancy and improving data integrity and query performance.
